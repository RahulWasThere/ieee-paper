\section{Experimental Settings}

This section details the experimental procedures followed in developing the fruit ripeness detection model. The experiment was conducted by building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model trained on a labeled dataset of real-time fruit images, with additional support from a Random Forest algorithm to enhance the accuracy of the detection \cite{IEEE_detection_model}.

\subsection{Dataset}
The dataset utilized for this study consists of over 700 real-time images of various fruits, labeled as either ripe or unripe. These images were captured under standardized lighting conditions and at various angles to ensure diversity in the training set. Key features such as texture, color, and size were carefully extracted from each image to build a robust model \cite{IEEE_feature_extraction}. The dataset was stored in the HDF5 format (\texttt{.h5}), ensuring efficient loading and training across different platforms \cite{IEEE_dataset_handling}.

Each image in the dataset was preprocessed to ensure consistency in input to the CNN model. Preprocessing steps included resizing the images to a fixed dimension of 224x224 pixels, normalization to scale pixel values between 0 and 1, and data augmentation to artificially expand the dataset. Augmentation techniques such as horizontal flipping, random rotations, and brightness adjustments were employed to make the model more robust against variations in real-world scenarios \cite{IEEE_data_augmentation}.

\subsection{Classifier Evaluation and Optimization}
The core classifier for fruit ripeness detection was a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which was trained to detect whether a fruit is ripe or unripe based on visual cues such as color, texture, and size. The CNN model was fine-tuned by applying various hyperparameter optimization techniques, such as grid search and random search \cite{IEEE_hyperparameter_optimization}. These techniques helped identify the optimal settings for learning rate, batch size, and the number of convolutional layers in the network.

In addition to the CNN, a Random Forest algorithm was employed to improve detection accuracy, especially for cases where the texture and size features played a more significant role than color in determining ripeness. Random Forests are known for their robustness and ability to handle noisy data, making them an ideal choice for enhancing the performance of the CNN model \cite{IEEE_random_forest_cnn}. The final system leverages both classifiers in a hybrid model, where the CNN focuses on color detection, and the Random Forest classifier evaluates texture and size for a more comprehensive detection \cite{IEEE_random_forest_hybrid}.

\subsection{Model Training and Optimization}
The CNN model was trained using the Adam optimizer, with an initial learning rate of 0.001. The training process involved minimizing the categorical cross-entropy loss function, commonly used in multi-class classification problems \cite{IEEE_loss_function}. Early stopping was implemented to halt training once the model's performance on the validation set began to degrade, thereby preventing overfitting.

Training was performed over 50 epochs, and a batch size of 32 was selected after extensive tuning. To ensure the model's generalization ability, 90\% of the dataset was allocated to training, while the remaining 10\% was reserved for testing. The model's performance was evaluated based on several metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score \cite{IEEE_cnn_model_performance}.

The Random Forest classifier was trained in parallel using texture and size features extracted from the images. This classifier was particularly useful in cases where the CNN's color-based predictions were insufficient, especially for fruits that undergo subtle texture changes as they ripen. The combination of both classifiers significantly boosted the overall detection accuracy \cite{IEEE_random_forest_accuracy}.

\subsection{Real-time Detection System}
A real-time fruit ripeness detection system was implemented using a live camera feed, where the trained CNN model is employed to classify incoming fruit images as ripe or unripe. The system leverages a pre-trained CNN model that processes the color of the fruit, and the Random Forest algorithm, which further refines the detection by analyzing texture and size features in real time \cite{IEEE_real_time_detection}. 

The system operates by capturing fruit images from the camera feed, preprocessing the images as described earlier, and passing them through the hybrid CNN-Random Forest model. The output is displayed on the interface, indicating whether the detected fruit is ripe or unripe. This system demonstrates high accuracy and reliability in diverse lighting conditions and fruit varieties, making it suitable for real-world agricultural applications \cite{IEEE_real_world_agriculture}.
\subsection{Model Evaluation Metrics}

The performance of the CNN and Random Forest hybrid model for fruit ripeness detection was evaluated using commonly used classification metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

\paragraph{Precision:} Precision measures the accuracy of the positive predictions made by the model. It is defined as the ratio of true positives (TP) to the sum of true positives and false positives (FP):

\begin{equation}
    \text{Precision} = \frac{TP}{TP + FP}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Recall:} Recall (also known as sensitivity or true positive rate) measures the ability of the model to correctly identify all positive instances. It is calculated as the ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false negatives (FN):

\begin{equation}
    \text{Recall} = \frac{TP}{TP + FN}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{F1-Score:} The F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a single metric that balances both. It is particularly useful when the class distribution is imbalanced:

\begin{equation}
    \text{F1-Score} = 2 \cdot \frac{\text{Precision} \cdot \text{Recall}}{\text{Precision} + \text{Recall}}
\end{equation}

\paragraph{Accuracy:} Accuracy represents the proportion of correct predictions (both true positives and true negatives) to the total number of predictions:

\begin{equation}
    \text{Accuracy} = \frac{TP + TN}{TP + TN + FP + FN}
\end{equation}

Where:
\begin{itemize}
    \item $TP$ = True Positives
    \item $TN$ = True Negatives
    \item $FP$ = False Positives
    \item $FN$ = False Negatives
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Evaluation:} The model was trained and evaluated using the above metrics, providing a comprehensive assessment of its performance in detecting ripe and unripe fruits.

\subsection{Software and Tools Used}
The model was implemented entirely using machine learning and deep learning software libraries. Python was the primary programming language, with Keras and TensorFlow used for the CNN model implementation \cite{IEEE_deep_learning_libraries}. Scikit-learn was used for implementing the Random Forest classifier \cite{IEEE_machine_learning_tool}. All experiments were conducted on a machine equipped with an NVIDIA GPU to accelerate the training process, alongside 16GB of RAM and an Intel Core i7 processor \cite{IEEE_software_tools}.

The experiments were conducted on Ubuntu 20.04, and the code was developed in Jupyter Notebooks for ease of testing and iteration. The trained model was stored as an HDF5 file and later loaded for real-time detection in the fruit ripeness system.
